Here’s a short description of the tools I used and the elements in MY web project:

Tools Used:
HTML: The structure of your website, organizing content into sections such as Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact.

CSS: For styling the website with a modern, clean design. Used to customize the layout, typography, colors, and responsive design.

JavaScript: Added interactivity, such as the language switcher and tab content toggling. Also used for form submission handling.

FontAwesome: Used for icons (e.g., social media links, portfolio icons) that enhance the website's visual appeal.

Google Sheets API: Integrated for form submissions, allowing users to send messages directly to a Google Sheet.

Google Fonts: To import custom fonts like Bebas Neue, giving the site a unique typography.

Key Elements:
Header Section: Includes a navigation bar, logo, and a greeting message.

About Section: Introduces you, Lesley, with information on your skills, experience, and education. It also features tabbed content for easy navigation between sections.

Services Section: Highlights your skills in Web Design, Data Analysis, and Customer Service, using interactive boxes with icons and descriptions.

Portfolio Section: Displays images of your work with hover effects, linking to external platforms like LinkedIn.

Contact Section: Contains a contact form for users to send inquiries and links to your social media profiles.

Language Switcher: A dropdown menu allows users to toggle between languages (English, French, Spanish, Arabic, German, Polish) to view content in their preferred language.

Responsive Design: The website adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience on mobile devices.

This combination of tools and elements provides a dynamic, engaging user experience while ensuring the site is functional, visually appealing, and accessible to a wide audience.
